A promise can have three states:

Pending: the initial state -> not completed
Fulfilled: operation was successfull -> e.g. promise might resolve with JSON Object as value 
Rejected: the opeartion has failed and promise has reason for failure -> usually an Error of some kind

Settled: when promise no longer pending (Fulfilled or Rejected)
All promises eventually settle,allowing us to write logic as what to do next


Promise function takes function parameter called executor function (executorFunction)
